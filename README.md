## Overview
A financial advisor normally asks a few questions to a new customer so as to understand their risk profile, and derives a ‘risk tolerance score’ (or risk preference) for the customer. The financial advisor has a few pre-defined portfolios which allocate a client’s money in certain proportions across multiple investment categories to balance risk.
